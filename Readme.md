# Movie Data Analysis

## Overview

This project explores a dataset of movies to uncover trends, patterns, and insights related to movie genres, release years, runtimes, popularity, and revenue. It involves data cleaning, feature engineering, exploratory data analysis, and drawing conclusions.

## Key Steps

1. **Data Wrangling:**
   - Examine the dataset's structure and summary statistics.
   - Identify missing values and outliers.
2. **Data Cleaning:**
   - Handle missing values by removing rows with missing data.
   - Address outliers using z-score calculations.
3. **Exploratory Data Analysis:**
   - Visualize distributions and relationships among variables using Seaborn and Matplotlib.
   - Examine descriptive statistics.
4. **Conclusions:**
   - Identify popular genres over the years.
   - Analyze runtime distributions and genre relationships.
   - Explore revenue-to-budget ratios.
   - Investigate interactions between popularity and vote averages.
   - Answer specific questions:
     - Movie counts in different runtime categories
     - Movie counts for each genre
     - Properties of high-revenue movies
     - What properties are associated with highly rated movies?
